The VM workflow:

(1) The user use the openstack dashboard - horizon to create the instance.
(2) Horizon send HTTP request to keystone for authentication.
(3) Keystone send token back to the horizon.
(4) Horizon send POST request to Nova. It contain the token and request for create instance.
(5) Nova send HTTP request to validate token to keystone.
(6) If request has been validated, no action has been taken yet.
(7) Nova call Neutron API to request provision network for instance.
(8) Neutron configuration IP address, gateway, subnet, DNS, etc.
(9) Nova request the instance image from Glance via imageid.
(10) If the imageid found, it send the URI back to nova and nova download image base on this URI.
